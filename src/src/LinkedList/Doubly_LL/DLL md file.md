# Doubly Linked List (DLL) â€” Add & Remove Operations

## 1. What is a Doubly Linked List?

A **Doubly Linked List (DLL)** is a type of linked list where each node contains:

* `data` â†’ stores the value.
* `next` â†’ reference to the next node.
* `prev` â†’ reference to the previous node.

This allows **bidirectional traversal** (forward and backward), unlike a singly linked list which allows traversal only in one direction.

### Structure of a Node

```
[ prev | data | next ]
```

### Visualization (add an image here)

ðŸ‘‰ *Insert an image showing Node with `prev` and `next` pointers.*

---

## 2. Adding a Node at the **Front**

Steps:

1. Create a new node.
2. If DLL is empty â†’ set `head = tail = newNode`.
3. Else:

    * Point `newNode.next = head`.
    * Set `head.prev = newNode`.
    * Update `head = newNode`.

### Visualization (add an image here)

ðŸ‘‰ *Show nodes being linked at the **start**.*

---

## 3. Adding a Node at the **End**

Steps:

1. Create a new node.
2. If DLL is empty â†’ set `head = tail = newNode`.
3. Else:

    * Point `tail.next = newNode`.
    * Set `newNode.prev = tail`.
    * Update `tail = newNode`.

### Visualization (add an image here)

ðŸ‘‰ *Show nodes being linked at the **end**.*

---

## 4. Removing a Node from the **Front**

Steps:

1. If DLL is empty â†’ print "Empty".
2. If size = 1:

    * Store value of `head`.
    * Set `head = tail = null`.
3. Else:

    * Store value of `head`.
    * Move `head = head.next`.
    * Set `head.prev = null`.

### Visualization (add an image here)

ðŸ‘‰ *Show how the **first node** is removed and head moves forward.*

---

## 5. Removing a Node from the **End**

Steps:

1. If DLL is empty â†’ print "Empty".
2. If size = 1:

    * Store value of `tail`.
    * Set `head = tail = null`.
3. Else:

    * Store value of `tail`.
    * Move `tail = tail.prev`.
    * Set `tail.next = null`.

### Visualization (add an image here)

ðŸ‘‰ *Show how the **last node** is removed and tail moves backward.*

## 6. Example Execution

Suppose we perform:

```
addFirst(1)
addFirst(2)
addLast(3)
addLast(4)
```

DLL after additions:

```
2 <-> 1 <-> 3 <-> 4 <-> null
```

After `removeFirst()`:

```
1 <-> 3 <-> 4 <-> null
```

After `removeLast()`:

```
1 <-> 3 <-> null
```

## 7. Advantages of DLL

* Can be traversed in **both directions**.
* Easy to **insert/delete from both ends**.
* More flexible than singly linked list.

---

## 8. Drawbacks of DLL

* Requires **extra memory** (for `prev` pointer).
* Operations take **slightly more time** (two pointers to update).
