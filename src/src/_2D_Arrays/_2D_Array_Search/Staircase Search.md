Got it 👍
Instead of explaining each file separately, I’ll **merge all four implementations** into **one combined explanation** in Markdown.

# 📘 Staircase Search in 2D Arrays

Searching for an element in a **2D sorted matrix** (sorted row-wise and column-wise) can be done efficiently using the **Staircase Search Algorithm**.

---

## 🔹 How the Matrix is Sorted

Example matrix:

```
10  20  30  40  
15  25  35  45  
27  29  37  48  
32  33  39  50  
```

* Each row is sorted **left → right**
* Each column is sorted **top → bottom**

This special property allows us to eliminate either a row or a column in each step.

---

## 🔹 Core Idea of Staircase Search

1. **Pick a strategic starting point**:

    * Either the **top-right** corner (`matrix[0][n-1]`)
    * Or the **bottom-left** corner (`matrix[n-1][0]`)

2. **Compare the current element with the key**:

    * If the current element equals the key → ✅ found
    * If the current element is greater than the key → move **left** (eliminate the current column)
    * If the current element is smaller than the key → move **down** (eliminate the current row)

3. **Continue until**:

    * The key is found
    * Or we move outside the matrix bounds (not found)

---

## 🔹 Efficiency Improvement

* Both **top-right** and **bottom-left** starting points work.
* To improve further, we can **compare both corners** (top-right & bottom-left) and choose the one that seems **closer to the key**.
* This avoids unnecessary steps and makes the search slightly faster in practice.

---

## 🔹 Complexity Analysis

* **Time Complexity:** `O(n + m)`

    * In the worst case, we might move across one full row and one full column.
* **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`

    * No extra data structures are used.

---

## 🔹 Example Trace

Searching for `33`:

1. Start at `40` (top-right). Since `40 > 33`, move left.
2. Now at `30`. Since `30 < 33`, move down.
3. Now at `37`. Since `37 > 33`, move left.
4. Now at `33`. ✅ Found at `(3,1)`

---

## ✅ Summary

* Staircase search is an **efficient way** to search in sorted 2D arrays.
* Works because rows and columns are sorted, allowing **elimination of one dimension per step**.
* Variations (different starting points or adaptive choice) all follow the same principle.
* Much faster than brute force (`O(n²)`) and simpler than applying binary search in 2D.
