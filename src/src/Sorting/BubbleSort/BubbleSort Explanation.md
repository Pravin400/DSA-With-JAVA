# \#\# 🔹 Your `bubblesort`

```java
for (int i = 0; i < number.length - 1; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < number.length - 1; j++) {
        if (number[j] > number[j+1]) {
            int temp = number[j];
            number[j] = number[j+1];
            number[j+1] = temp;
        }
    }
}
```


### ✅ What it does:

* Outer loop runs `n-1` times.
* Inner loop **always compares from `0` to `n-2`**, regardless of how many elements are already sorted.

👉 That means even when the last `i` elements are already in the correct position, it **still keeps checking them unnecessarily**.

### ⏱ Time Complexity:

* Always **O(n²)** comparisons and swaps, no matter what.

---

## 🔹 Your `bubblesort1`

```java
for (int i = 0; i < number.length - 1; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < number.length - i - 1; j++) {
        if (number[j] > number[j + 1]) {
            int temp = number[j];
            number[j] = number[j + 1];
            number[j + 1] = temp;
        }
    }
}
```


### ✅ What it does:

* Outer loop runs `n-1` times.
* Inner loop runs only up to `n-i-1`.
    * After the first pass, the **largest element is already at the end** → no need to compare it again.
    * After the second pass, the **two largest elements are at the end** → skip them.
* So gradually, the inner loop checks **fewer and fewer elements**.

👉 This is the **optimized bubble sort** compared to your first one.

### ⏱ Time Complexity:

* Still **O(n²)** in the worst case.
* But does **fewer comparisons**, so practically faster than your first version.

---

## 🔑 Key Difference:

* `bubblesort` → checks the whole array every pass (wasteful).
* `bubblesort1` → avoids re-checking the sorted portion at the end of the array.

⚡ If you also add a **`swapped` flag** to stop when no swaps happen in a pass, then it becomes even better → **Best case O(n)** (already sorted array).

---

👉 Do you want me to **rewrite your `bubblesort1` with that `swapped` optimization** and show how it stops early when the array is already sorted?
give the md file for that

Got it 👍 You want a clean **Markdown (`.md`) note** comparing your two bubble sort versions and then showing the improved `swapped` optimization.
Here’s the ready file:

# 🔄 Bubble Sort Variants in Java

---

## 🔹 Version 1: `bubblesort`

```

for (int i = 0; i < number.length - 1; i++) {
for (int j = 0; j < number.length - 1; j++) {
if (number[j] > number[j+1]) {
int temp = number[j];
number[j] = number[j+1];
number[j+1] = temp;
}
}
}

```

### ✅ What it does:
- Outer loop runs **n-1 times**.  
- Inner loop **always compares from 0 to n-2**, even if the last part is already sorted.  

👉 **Drawback:**  
- Re-checks elements that are already placed correctly at the end.  
- Wasteful comparisons.  

### ⏱ Time Complexity:
- **Worst Case:** O(n²)  
- **Best Case:** O(n²) (no early stopping)  
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)  

---

## 🔹 Version 2: `bubblesort1` (Optimized Passes)

```

for (int i = 0; i < number.length - 1; i++) {
for (int j = 0; j < number.length - i - 1; j++) {
if (number[j] > number[j + 1]) {
int temp = number[j];
number[j] = number[j + 1];
number[j + 1] = temp;
}
}
}

```

### ✅ What it does:
- Outer loop still runs **n-1 times**.  
- Inner loop runs only **n-i-1 times** each pass.  

👉 Meaning:  
- After pass 1 → largest element is at end → skip it.  
- After pass 2 → last 2 elements fixed → skip them.  
- Gradually fewer comparisons.  

### ⏱ Time Complexity:
- **Worst Case:** O(n²)  
- **Best Case:** O(n²) (still no stopping condition)  
- **Space:** O(1)  
- But practically **faster than Version 1**.  

---

## 🔹 Version 3: `bubblesort2` (With Early Exit Optimization ✅)

```

for (int i = 0; i < number.length - 1; i++) {
boolean swapped = false;
for (int j = 0; j < number.length - i - 1; j++) {
if (number[j] > number[j + 1]) {
int temp = number[j];
number[j] = number[j + 1];
number[j + 1] = temp;
swapped = true;
}
}
// If no swaps happened → already sorted → stop early
if (!swapped) break;
}

```

### ✅ What it does:
- Same as `bubblesort1` (reduces unnecessary comparisons).  
- Adds a **`swapped` flag** → if no swaps are made in a pass, the array is already sorted → break early.  

👉 Big advantage in **nearly sorted arrays**.  

### ⏱ Time Complexity:
- **Worst Case:** O(n²)  
- **Best Case:** O(n) (if array is already sorted)  
- **Space:** O(1)

## 🔑 Summary of All Versions

| Version        | Comparisons per Pass | Stops Early? | Worst Case | Best Case |
|----------------|----------------------|--------------|------------|-----------|
| `bubblesort`   | Always n-1           | ❌ No        | O(n²)      | O(n²)     |
| `bubblesort1`  | n-i-1                | ❌ No        | O(n²)      | O(n²)     |
| `bubblesort2`  | n-i-1                | ✅ Yes       | O(n²)      | O(n)      |

---

## 📌 Key Takeaway
- **Version 1** → naive implementation, wasteful.  
- **Version 2** → avoids re-checking sorted part.  
- **Version 3** → final optimized variation ✅ → best practical performance.
