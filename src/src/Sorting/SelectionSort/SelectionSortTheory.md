Got it 👍 You don’t want code now, only a **Markdown (md) explanation** for understanding **Selection Sort**.
Here’s a clear breakdown in Markdown:

# 🌀 Selection Sort – Explanation

## 🔹 What is Selection Sort?

Selection Sort is a **comparison-based sorting algorithm**.
It repeatedly selects the **smallest (or largest)** element from the unsorted part of the array and places it at the **beginning** of the sorted part.

---

## 🔹 How it Works (Step by Step)

1. **Start from the first element** → Assume it is the smallest.
2. **Search the entire array** (or remaining unsorted part) to find the actual smallest element.
3. **Swap** the found smallest element with the first element.
4. Now, the first element is **sorted**.
5. Move to the **second position** and repeat the process for the rest of the array.
6. Continue until all elements are placed in the correct order.

## 🔹 Example

Consider the array:

```
[64, 25, 12, 22, 11]
```

### Pass 1:

* Smallest element in `[64, 25, 12, 22, 11]` is **11**.
* Swap 11 with 64 →

```
[11, 25, 12, 22, 64]
```

### Pass 2:

* Now look at `[25, 12, 22, 64]`. Smallest is **12**.
* Swap 12 with 25 →

```
[11, 12, 25, 22, 64]
```

### Pass 3:

* Now look at `[25, 22, 64]`. Smallest is **22**.
* Swap 22 with 25 →

```
[11, 12, 22, 25, 64]
```

### Pass 4:

* Look at `[25, 64]`. Smallest is **25** (already in place).
* No change.

✅ Final Sorted Array:

```
[11, 12, 22, 25, 64]
```

## 🔹 Time & Space Complexity

* **Best Case (Already Sorted)** → `O(n²)` (still checks all elements)
* **Worst Case** → `O(n²)`
* **Average Case** → `O(n²)`
* **Space Complexity** → `O(1)` (in-place sorting, no extra memory needed)

---

## 🔹 Characteristics

* Simple but **not efficient** for large datasets.
* Always performs the same number of comparisons (`n²`).
* Works well for **small arrays** or when memory is very limited.

👉 Do you want me to also create a **step-by-step dry run table (like iterations with indexes)** in Markdown so you can visualize how the algorithm moves elements?
