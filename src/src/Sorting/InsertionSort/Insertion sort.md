# 🔹 Insertion Sort 

### 📝 Idea:

* Insertion sort builds the **sorted portion** of the array one element at a time.
* It takes the current element and **inserts it into its correct position** among the previously sorted elements.
* Works similar to **sorting cards in your hand** while playing.

## 🎴 Card Analogy (Real-Life Pattern)

Imagine you are holding playing cards:

1. Start with one card → already sorted.
2. Pick the next card → insert it at the correct place among the sorted cards.
3. Continue this until all cards are arranged.

👉 This is exactly how **Insertion Sort** works.

## 🔄 Example: Dry Run

Array:

```
[5, 3, 4, 1, 2]
```

**Step 1:** First element `[5]` → already sorted.

**Step 2:** Take `3`. Compare with `5`. Since `3 < 5`, insert before `5`.
`[3, 5, 4, 1, 2]`

**Step 3:** Take `4`. Compare with `5`. Since `4 < 5`, move `5` right. Compare with `3`, `4 > 3`, so place after `3`.
`[3, 4, 5, 1, 2]`

**Step 4:** Take `1`. Compare with `5 → 1 < 5`, move `5`.
Compare with `4 → 1 < 4`, move `4`.
Compare with `3 → 1 < 3`, move `3`.
Insert at start.
`[1, 3, 4, 5, 2]`

**Step 5:** Take `2`. Compare with `5, 4, 3`. Insert before `3`.
`[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`

✅ Sorted!

## ⏱ Complexity

* **Best Case (Already Sorted):** `O(n)` (just one comparison per element).
* **Worst Case (Reversed):** `O(n²)`.
* **Space Complexity:** `O(1)` (in-place).

👉 Works very well for **small arrays or partially sorted arrays**.

## 💡 Use Cases of Insertion Sort

1. **Sorting playing cards / hand arrangement** 🎴
2. **When array is already nearly sorted** → faster than Bubble or Selection Sort.
3. **Small datasets** → simple and efficient.
4. **Online sorting** → can sort data as it arrives (one by one).
   Example: typing words in a list while keeping it alphabetically sorted.

## 💻 Java Code (Insertion Sort)

```java
private static void insertionsort(int[] arr) {

    for (int i = 1; i < arr.length ; i++) {
        int current = arr[i];
        int prev = i - 1;
        while (prev >= 0 && arr[prev] > current) {
            arr[prev + 1] = arr[prev];
            prev--;
        }
        arr[prev + 1] = current;
    }
}
```

⚡ Quick Recap (for memory trick):

* Think of **playing cards in your hand**.
* Each new card is **inserted in the right place** among the sorted ones.
* Efficient for **small or nearly sorted arrays**.

👉 Do you want me to also prepare a **Markdown (md) note file like Bubble Sort day** for **Insertion Sort** (with dry run + code + use cases) so you can keep a full “Sorting Notes” collection?
