# 📘 Day 001 - Arrays in Java

This is the beginning of my DSA journey — starting with **Arrays in Java**. In this session, I covered the fundamentals of arrays, how to use them effectively in Java, and practiced them through multiple hands-on examples.

## 🧠 What is an Array?

An **array** is a data structure that stores a fixed-size sequence of elements of the same data type. Arrays are stored in contiguous memory locations and are indexed starting from 0.\
An **array** in Java is a data structure that can hold multiple values of the same data type. It is a fixed-size container that stores elements in a **contiguous memory location** and allows **random access** via indices.


### ✅ Why Use Arrays?
- Group similar data types together
- Easy random access using index
- Memory-efficient when the size is fixed

### ✅ Advantages of Arrays:
- **Fast Access** – Direct access to elements via index (O(1) time).
- **Better Cache Locality** – Improves performance due to contiguous memory.
- **Simple Syntax** – Easy to declare and use.

### ❌ Disadvantages of Arrays:
- Fixed size (cannot be resized once initialized)
- Insertion and deletion are costly (shift operations required)
- **Limited Flexibility** – Can't hold mixed data types or grow dynamically.
- Homogeneous data only

## 📌 Summary

This marks the beginning of structured learning in DSA. Arrays are a building block of most algorithms, and today was about understanding their core principles and writing hands-on Java programs to solidify that learning.
