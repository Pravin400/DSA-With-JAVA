# 📘 DSA Learning Journey - Day 2: Arrays (Searching and Sorting)

✅ Topics Covered
On Day 2, we focused entirely on Arrays, diving into searching and sorting techniques with hands-on coding and conceptual understanding.

🔹 What is an Array?
An array is a collection of elements stored at contiguous memory locations. It allows storing multiple items of the same data type using a single variable name.
java
CopyEdit
int[] arr = new int[5]; // Declaration and allocation

🔍 Linear Search
Definition:
Linear Search is the simplest searching algorithm. It checks every element in the array sequentially until the desired element is found or the array ends.
Time Complexity:
Worst Case: O(n)
Best Case: O(1) (if the element is found at the beginning)
Java Code Example:
java
CopyEdit
public class LinearSearch {
public static int search(int[] arr, int target) {
for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
if (arr[i] == target) {
return i; // target found at index i
}
}
return -1; // target not found
}
}

🔁 Sorting
What is Sorting?
Sorting is the process of arranging data in either ascending or descending order. It improves the performance of search algorithms like Binary Search.

🔹 Bubble Sort
Definition:
Bubble Sort is a comparison-based algorithm where each pair of adjacent elements is compared and swapped if they are in the wrong order.
Time Complexity:
Worst \& Average: O(n²)
Best Case (already sorted): O(n)
Java Code Example:
java
CopyEdit
public class BubbleSort {
public static void sort(int[] arr) {
int n = arr.length;
for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
boolean swapped = false;
for (int j = 0; j < n - i - 1; j++) {
if (arr[j] > arr[j+1]) {
// swap arr[j] and arr[j+1]
int temp = arr[j];
arr[j] = arr[j+1];
arr[j+1] = temp;
swapped = true;
}
}
if (!swapped) break;
}
}
}

Linear search is not optimal for large datasets.
Sorting helps optimize searching and data organization.
Bubble sort is simple but not efficient for large data.

# 📘 DSA Learning Journey – Day 2: Arrays (Searching \& Sorting)

Welcome to Day 2 of your Data Structures \& Algorithms (DSA) learning journey! Today, we focused on arrays, covering essential searching and sorting techniques through both hands-on coding and conceptual discussion.

## ✅ Topics Covered

- **What is an Array?**
- **Searching in Arrays: Linear Search**
- **Sorting Arrays: Bubble Sort**
- **Time Complexity Analysis**
- **Key Takeaways \& Summary**
- **Notes \& Next Steps**


## 🔹 What is an Array?

An **array** is a collection of elements stored at contiguous memory locations, allowing you to store multiple items of the same data type with a single variable name.

```java
int[] arr = new int[5]; // Declaration and allocation
```


## 🔍 Linear Search

**Definition:**
Linear Search is the simplest search algorithm. It checks each element in the array sequentially until the desired element is found or the array ends.

- **Time Complexity:**
    - Worst Case: O(n)
    - Best Case: O(1) (if the target is at the beginning)

**Java Example:**

```java
public class LinearSearch {
    public static int search(int[] arr, int target) {
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            if (arr[i] == target) {
                return i; // target found at index i
            }
        }
        return -1; // target not found
    }
}
```


## 🔁 Sorting

**What is Sorting?**
Sorting organizes elements in an array in ascending or descending order, which is crucial for efficient searching (like binary search) and better data management.

### Bubble Sort

- **Definition:**
Bubble Sort is a straightforward comparison-based algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
- **Time Complexity:**
    - Worst \& Average: O(n²)
    - Best: O(n) (already sorted array)

**Java Example:**

```java
public class BubbleSort {
    public static void sort(int[] arr) {
        int n = arr.length;
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            boolean swapped = false;
            for (int j = 0; j < n - i - 1; j++) {
                if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1]) {
                    // Swap arr[j] and arr[j+1]
                    int temp = arr[j];
                    arr[j] = arr[j + 1];
                    arr[j + 1] = temp;
                    swapped = true;
                }
            }
            if (!swapped) break;
        }
    }
}
```
